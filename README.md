# Python Utilities for ThingSpeak

This repository contains a collection of Python utilities designed to interact with [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/). These scripts help you automate common tasks such as:

- **Downloading data** from ThingSpeak channels.  
- **Building web applications** with live or historical graphs.    

# Program Description

This program is designed to [briefly explain the program's main purpose or functionality].

## Configuration

### User API Keys

The program requires a list of User API Keys to function correctly. These API keys are used to authenticate users and ensure secure access to the application's features. The API keys should be provided in the `user_API_Key` variable within the code.

Here is an example:

```python
# List of User API keys
user_API_Key = ["XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"]
```

### Instructions:
1. Replace the placeholder values (`"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"`) in the `user_API_Key` list with the actual API keys for your users.
2. Each key should be a unique string provided by the API service you are integrating with.
3. Ensure the keys are kept secure and not shared publicly.
