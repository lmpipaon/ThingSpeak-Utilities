# Python Utilities for ThingSpeak

This repository contains a collection of Python utilities designed to interact with [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/). These scripts help you automate common tasks such as:

- **Downloading data** from ThingSpeak channels.  
- **Building web applications** with live or historical graphs.

# ThingSpeak Data Visualizer

## Overview
The `ThingSpeakDataVisualizer.py` program is designed to create a web page (`.html` file) that displays a graphical visualization of data retrieved from ThingSpeak channels. This tool simplifies the process of transforming raw IoT data into an interactive and easily shareable visual format.

## Features
- Fetches data from specified ThingSpeak channels using their API keys.
- Generates a fully functional HTML file with embedded charts.
- Supports multiple fields from ThingSpeak channels for comprehensive data representation.
- User-friendly and ready for direct use or further customization.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install the required dependencies (if any). Check the `requirements.txt` file for a list of dependencies.

### Running the Program
1. Configure the program to include your ThingSpeak channel IDs and API keys.
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python ThingSpeakDataVisualizer.py
   ```
3. The program will generate an HTML file in the current directory.

### Viewing the Output
- Open the generated HTML file in any web browser to view the graphical visualization of your ThingSpeak data.

## Notes
- Make sure your ThingSpeak channels and API keys are valid.
- For the best experience, ensure your data is well-structured and up-to-date on ThingSpeak.
- The generated HTML file can be hosted on a web server or shared directly with others.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the generated HTML file or the program itself to better suit your needs. For example, you can:
- Change the chart type or styling.
- Add additional data sources or combine multiple channels.

# Program Description
- ThingSpeakDataVisualizer.py
- ThingSpeakDownloader.py

## Configuration

### User API Keys

The program requires a list of User API Keys to function correctly. These API keys are used to authenticate users and ensure secure access to the application's features. The API keys should be provided in the `user_API_Key` variable within the code.

Here is an example:

```python
# List of User API keys
user_API_Key = ["XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"]
```

### Instructions:
1. Replace the placeholder values (`"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"`) in the `user_API_Key` list with the actual API keys for your users.
2. Each key should be a unique string provided by the API service you are integrating with.
3. Ensure the keys are kept secure and not shared publicly.
