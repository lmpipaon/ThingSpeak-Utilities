# Python Utilities for ThingSpeak

This repository contains a collection of Python utilities designed to interact with [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/). These scripts help you automate common tasks such as:

- **Downloading data** from ThingSpeak channels.  
- **Building web applications** with live or historical graphs.  
- **Streamlining data processing** for IoT projects.  

Whether you're an IoT enthusiast or a developer looking to simplify your ThingSpeak workflows, this repository offers ready-to-use tools to get started.

Feel free to contribute or customize the scripts to fit your specific needs!



# Program Description

This program is designed to [briefly explain the program's main purpose or functionality].

## Configuration

### User API Keys

The program requires a list of User API Keys to function correctly. These API keys are used to authenticate users and ensure secure access to the application's features. The API keys should be provided in the `user_API_Key` variable within the code.

Here is an example:

```python
# List of User API keys
user_API_Key = ["XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"]
```

### Instructions:
1. Replace the placeholder values (`"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"`) in the `user_API_Key` list with the actual API keys for your users.
2. Each key should be a unique string provided by the API service you are integrating with.
3. Ensure the keys are kept secure and not shared publicly.

### Example:
If you have two users with the following API keys:
- User 1: `abc12345`
- User 2: `def67890`

Update the code as follows:

```python
# List of User API keys
user_API_Key = ["abc12345", "def67890"]
```

## Notes
- Make sure that API keys are valid and match the requirements of the API service.
- To improve security, consider storing API keys in environment variables or secure configuration files instead of directly in the code.

For further assistance, please refer to the documentation of the API service you are working with or contact support.
